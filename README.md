# CNN Feature Map Visualizer

A web application built with Next.js that allows users to upload an image, view its predicted classification probabilities, and visualize the feature maps generated by an underlying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Upload JPEG or PNG images via a simple drag-and-drop or file selection interface.
- **Classification Display:** Shows the top 10 predicted class probabilities for the uploaded image based on a backend classification model.
- **Feature Map Visualization:** Renders multiple (currently 35) 64x64 grayscale feature maps extracted from the CNN, displayed in a grid layout.
- **Interactive UI:** Simple and clean interface built with Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React framework)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **API:** Next.js API Routes (handling `/api/classify` and `/api/feature-maps`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version 18.x or later recommended)
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun (package manager)
- A running backend service capable of handling requests to `/api/classify` and `/api/feature-maps`. _(Note: The backend implementation is not included in this specific frontend repository)_

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

4.  **Open the application:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1.  Ensure the backend service for classification and feature map extraction is running.
2.  Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3.  Click on the "Click to upload an image" area to select a JPEG or PNG image file.
4.  Once uploaded, the image preview will appear on the left.
5.  The classification probabilities for the 10 target classes will be displayed below the preview.
6.  The extracted feature maps (35 maps of 64x64 pixels) will be rendered as grayscale images in the grid on the right panel.
7.  Click the 'Ã—' button on the image preview to clear the current image and upload a new one.

## API Endpoints

This frontend interacts with the following backend API endpoints (expected to be running separately or defined within `/pages/api` or `/app/api` if using Next.js API routes):

- `POST /api/classify`: Accepts an image file (`multipart/form-data`) and returns JSON with `class_probabilities` (an array of numbers).
- `POST /api/feature-maps`: Accepts an image file (`multipart/form-data`) and returns JSON with `feature_maps` (expected to be a 3D array, e.g., `[64][64][35]` containing numbers).
